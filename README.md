This website is a personal website I made for the GWC Self-Paced Program for Intro to HTML!
I made this project since I wanted to have kind of a personal website I could update easily. During a computer science class I took, I made pretty bad websites using only html and it looked like something from myspace but I loved it.
I made this project using bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. I recently updated the button links as well as the descriptions to better suit my personality as well as my porfolio. :)
Something I struggled with making this project was aligning the picture, button, and description into thirds under the video until I found the flexbox.
